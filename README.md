# Thyroid Cancer Risk Prediction

This project aims to predict the risk of thyroid cancer using machine learning techniques. It includes data analysis in R and Python, a web application, and a detailed report and presentation.

## 🩺 Problem

Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest-growing cancer types globally. Early detection using routine health records and machine learning techniques can help guide further testing and intervention.

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** in Python
- **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Data Analysis** including Factor Analyis for Mixed Data(FAMD) and Cluster Analysis
- **Model Fitting**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Classification Trees, Random Forest, XG Boost
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **Web App**: Built to demonstrate prediction
